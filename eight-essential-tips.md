# Eight Essential Tips for the Enlightened Tech Writer

In this talk, I'll provide eight essential tips that will help you become a more effective writer. With these principles, you'll take back control of your schedule, make your customers happier, find the info you need faster, and have more fun along the way. The tips are:

1. Just ask. The idea for this talk started during the WTD hike in 2016, when Jacob Moses started asking about my work. Later he asked me to be a guest on his podcast to discuss how to future proof yourself as a tech writer.  The idea of being bold and just asking people, as Jacob did, is one of the most important things you can do.  One of my favorites is how did you get started with that?
2. Then, listen with an open heart and mind. Listen fully.  Give your full attention.  It's hard but it gets easier the more you practice.
3. Tell stories.  This can apply to everything you do.  Even when you put up your automatic email reply.  (Find an example or two in the media.) When you tell a story, adjust how you begin for the audience. Give the high level clue-in as needed.  Storytelling is one of the most important skills you can learn. I'll include resources at the end.
4. Own your stuff. One of my former colleagues always had an excuse why he couldn't do something because someone else hadn't come through. As tech writers, sometimes we feel like we are at the end of the chain. A key realization is that you own your docs like a developer owns their code. You make the final decisions.  A writer asking "should the docs say x or y" is like a reporter asking "should the story say x or y" Instead, ask for input, own the output.
5. Find go-to people.   There is a doc-friendly person in every group. If they're willing, have them review the doc first.
6. Minimum viable is your friend.  Use the "just send me something" gambit, with the caveat that it doesn't have to be perfect. When emailing on a tech review, instead of asking questions about the doc, put the actual text in the mail and iterate on that.   Include a default course of action. 
7. Always be learning. Have a preferred super tool for automating stuff.  Learn by incremental doing.
8. Say yes.  Seize the moment when your manager says who wants to do the new task.  Cultivate an up for anything mindset.  Help others learn and succeed.

Bonus tip: The bonus is tiny but mighty. Give praise.  Highest benefit to cost ratio you'll ever see.

This talk is for all documentarians, with a slight skew to those newer to the discipline. Basic writing workflow is the only assumed background knowledge. The takeaway is that the writer is more empowered, effective, and has a more enriching career.

## Bio

My name is Ted Hudek, and I've been a tech writer at Microsoft for almost 20 years. I first came to WTD in 2015, when I was blown away to find all the people like me. Then I came back in 2016 and was part of the first WTD panel, where I discussed open publishing work at Microsoft. Later in 2016, I was a guest on the Not-Boring Tech Writer podcast hosted by Jacob Moses.
