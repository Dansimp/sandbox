# Essential Tips for the Enlightened Tech Writer

In this talk, I'll provide six essential tips that will help you become a more effective tech writer. These are core principles that have guided me during almost two decades in the business:

1. Just ask. Be curious and network.

[I think the following bullets are more tactical.  Consider the truly big opportunities you've had to network and what that opened up for you. ] 
* The idea for this talk started during the WTD hike in 2016, when Jacob Moses started asking about my work. Later he asked me to be a guest on his podcast to discuss how to future proof yourself as a tech writer. Be bold and just ask, as Jacob did, and you'll discover a wealth of new opportunities. [Good start and a good way to kick off the talk]
* Recently, a PM pinged me about a bug and asked how it fit in my priority list.  Because he reminded me mid-morning, I wound up doing the task the same day.  Time your question. [this, to me, feel small and somewhat inconsequential. Might want to consider "should I even be working on this thing at all? Is it really a priority?" Might want to make way for a different example here.
* New person in related role emailed and said would love to hear feedback if you want to have coffee sometime.  Result was a highly productive meeting. [same feedback as above]
* A few months ago, I asked if I could join a key strategic meeting.  It's a phone meeting with a tight agenda, so afterward I reach out to people individually to ask specific questions. [what was the meeting and why was it important? Why did they let you in? What were you to get out of it? These are the questions to answer here.]
* You can even ask with no words, just by being there: I used to camp out in the lounge of the feature team, and got plenty of serendipitous encounters.  People would come up and frequently say something like "That reminds me, I'd been meaning to tell you about xyz." [cool]

2. Listen.  As writers, we need to understand where customers are in their journey and where they need help. At MS, we have a collaborative docs platform that empowers customers to give us feedback and propose changes, with a vastly shorter loop. We use data to inform content decisions, what customers need, and what they don't. Quality is defined by customers not us, and we provide content to them where they are, whether that be on desktop or mobile.

3. Tell stories.  This applies to everything you do.  Even your automatic email reply.  Pay attention to how you start [start what?]. Newspaper articles frequently start with an anecdote [actually newspaper articles start with the most important item first. Opinion pieces often start with anecdotes.] When you tell a story, adjust how you begin for the audience, providing a high level clue-in as needed.  Storytelling is one of the most important skills you can learn. It binds us together as humans. Focus on authenticity, build brand trust and create a more human experience. Choose the most important content sets to curate e2e experience.

4. Own your stuff. As tech writers, sometimes we feel like we are at the end of the chain. Own your docs like a developer owns their code. You make the final decisions.  A writer asking "should the docs say x or y" is like a reporter asking "should the story say x or y." Ask for input, own the output.
Also take ownership for the product experience as a whole. It is our responsibility to provide feedback to others teams when we see something that's not right. Think of yourself as an investigative reporter. We have a unique opportunity as writers to bind the product together.

5. Minimum content. We modern humans are we're overwhelmed. Day in and day out we face a constant stream of news, socmed updates, alerts, pings, pokes, and more. We fight for customer attention, and they have precious little left to give. As writers, we need to create the least amount of content that gets the job done. Any more is too much.  Take Microsoft for example.  We've spent decades building up lots of dev docs and technical content. It's accumulated over the years and now, we've spent the last six months tearing down 100k topics and putting them in legacy. Our problem as content providers is how to keep customers informed of what they need without overwhelming them. The solution is to provide the least amount of content that ensures that your customers succeed. Get the content out fast and get customers going. Perfection is not when you're can't add anything, but when you can't remove anything.

6. Always keep learning. Be a lifelong learner. I said this before, but be curious. Challenge yourself to wade into new waters and don't let complacency take hold. Not only help yourself, but help others along their journey. Mentor relationships can be powerful. Have a preferred super tool for automating stuff.  (PowerShell, Python) Learn the tools your customers use. Learn by incremental doing.
Stay relevant in market.  Seize opportunities, don't wait to work to be assigned to you, stand up and grab opportunities. Cultivate an all-in mindset.  Help and learn from others.

A tiny but mighty bonus tip: Give praise.  Highest benefit to cost ratio you'll ever see. For example, we thank people for every pull request we receive.
