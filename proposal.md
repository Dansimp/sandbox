Catching Serendipity: Making it Easy to Contribute to the Docs
=======
Last year was my first year at Write the Docs, and I knew nothing about Git or Markdown. At that time, we wrote developer docs in structured XML pages that were locked away in a private enlistment of proprietary tools and complex schemas.  Publishing happened on a schedule, usually weekly, sometimes longer.  New writers had to spend a few days getting permissions and learning the authoring environment.  Outside contributions happened via attachments in email. 

I came back from the conference with some ideas, and I joined some like-minded folks, and slowly, we started a revolution. Three months later, we published our first docs sourced from Markdown, shared via GitHub, and rendered directly onto the Microsoft website.

In this talk, I'll share some lessons we learned along the way.  I'll describe the journey from vault to community, and you'll discover how opening your content can deliver:

* Delighted feature teams
* More time for writers to do deep scenario work
* A net that can catch serendipity
