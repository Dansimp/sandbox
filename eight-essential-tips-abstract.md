# Eight Essential Tips: Abstract

In this talk, I'll provide eight essential tips that will help you become a more effective tech writer. These are core principles that have guided me during almost two decades in the business.  I'll illustrate each one with real-life stories to show you what kind of results you can expect.

The tips are:

1. Just ask.
2. Listen fully.
3. Tell stories.
4. Own your stuff.
5. Find go-to people.
6. Minimum viable is your friend.
7. Always keep learning.
8. Say yes.

I'll include a bonus tip.  This talk is for all documentarians, with a slight skew to those newer to the discipline. Basic writing workflow is the only assumed background knowledge. With these tips, you'll be more empowered, more effective, and have a more enriching career.
